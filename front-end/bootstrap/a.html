			  			<h3> Blue Fish is one of the best places in Dallas for Sushi. It's well known locally. While working for Favor, I picked up many orders from The Blue Fish Restaurants. Customers say the sushi is always top quality, crisp, cold, fresh and delicious. There are several locations in the Dallas area. I usually go to the one in Lower Greenville has a nice outdoor patio. This place has the customers best interests at heart because all of the food is prepared in an open viewable area.  </h3>

			  			<h3> Snap Kitchen is the place in Dallas to get to go healthy food. It's known as a pick up spot rather than a dine in restaurant so customers can select their favorite meal choice online and pick up their meal choice cfrom the store. Expect a clean enviroment when entering the store. I've been there multiple times and every time the store looks spotless and clean.  Their culture is built on a genuine passion for food and the workers there share that passion with others. Another reason to eat here is because they help community by donating unsold food to charitable food rescue organizations and non-profits daily, and assist with education, nutrition, sustainability and health programs. </h3>

			  		<a href= > Benny's Bagels </a></li>
			  			<h3> Benny's Bagels in Dallas has the freshest made bagels in Dallas. They reason their bagels are so good is because they boil them. If you want a New York style bagel, this is the place to visit. The bagels come with onions, cheese spread, meats, veggies, and drinks. Wake up early, don't snooze to visit this place because it gets crowded very early in the morning. The bagels are so good that customers line up and wait for up to 30 minues just to get one bagel. The staff is friendly and creates a live environment complete with the latest music that is heard all the way outside of the store.   </h3>
